<h1>Functions of Speech in English Grammar</h1>

<div class="function-section">
  <h2>1. Subject</h2>
  <p>The <strong>subject</strong> is the person, place, thing, or idea that performs the action of the verb or is described by it. In English sentences, the subject typically comes before the verb.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> "The <em>cat</em> sleeps on the mat."</p>
  <p><em>Explanation:</em> "<strong>The cat</strong>" is the subject because it is performing the action of sleeping.</p>
</div>

<div class="function-section">
  <h2>2. Direct Object</h2>
  <p>The <strong>direct object</strong> is the noun or pronoun that receives the action of a transitive verb directly. It answers the question "What?" or "Whom?" in relation to the verb.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> "She read <em>the book</em>."</p>
  <p><em>Explanation:</em> "<strong>The book</strong>" is the direct object because it receives the action of reading.</p>
</div>

<div class="function-section">
  <h2>3. Object of Preposition</h2>
  <p>The <strong>object of the preposition</strong> is the noun or pronoun that follows a preposition, creating a prepositional phrase that typically shows location, direction, time, or manner.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> "The cat sleeps on <em>the mat</em>."</p>
  <p><em>Explanation:</em> "<strong>The mat</strong>" is the object of the preposition "on."</p>
</div>

<div class="function-section">
  <h2>4. Predicative Complement</h2>
  <p>The <strong>predicative complement</strong> (also called a subject complement) is a word or phrase that follows a linking verb (such as "be," "seem," "become") and provides more information about the subject or object.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> "She is <em>a doctor</em>."</p>
  <p><em>Explanation:</em> "<strong>A doctor</strong>" describes "she" and completes the meaning of the subject via the linking verb "is."</p>
</div>

<div class="function-section">
  <h2>5. Modifier</h2>
  <p>A <strong>modifier</strong> is a word or phrase (often an adjective or adverb) that provides additional information about another word, such as a noun or verb.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> "She bought a <em>beautiful</em> dress."</p>
  <p><em>Explanation:</em> "<strong>Beautiful</strong>" modifies "dress" by describing its appearance.</p>
</div>

<div class="function-section">
  <h2>6. Adjunct</h2>
  <p>An <strong>adjunct</strong> is a word or phrase that adds extra information to a sentence but is not essential to its core meaning. Adjuncts often indicate time, place, manner, frequency, or reason.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> "She went to the store <em>yesterday</em>."</p>
  <p><em>Explanation:</em> "<strong>Yesterday</strong>" is an adjunct of time, adding information about when she went but not changing the fundamental meaning of the sentence.</p>
</div>

<div class="function-section">
  <h2>7. Determiner</h2>
  <p>A <strong>determiner</strong> is a word that comes before a noun to specify reference. Determiners can indicate things like definiteness (e.g., "the," "a"), quantity (e.g., "many," "few"), possession (e.g., "my," "his"), or other details.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> "<em>The</em> cat sleeps on the mat."</p>
  <p><em>Explanation:</em> "<strong>The</strong>" specifies the particular "cat" being referred to.</p>
</div>
